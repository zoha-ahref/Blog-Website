# Blog-Website
blog website built using Flask fRAMEWORK
In this project Iâ€™ve created a multipage, mobile responsive blog website with an interactive navigation bar using Bootstrap. 
It contains dynamically generated blog post pages with full screen titles.
This application is built using Flask Framework and I have used Jinja to produce Dynamic HTML pages. 
Other than this Flask-WTForms and SQLite database are used.
You can read, edit, post and delete the blog posts as well
